Hello world! 
My name is Linda. It is spelled "eLL I eNN De A" ;) 
I'm a sewing pattern designer, in this context I've worked with Inkscape (similar to Illustrator) a lot.
For my first website for my sewing pattern business I used some "homepage-build-software" which was not satisfactory, I made the second one with wordpress.
I also helped other people with their wordpress websites. Later I decided I want to learn how to code because it felt like I had achieved everything in making sewing patterns 
and I realized it has always been the technical aspect of this work that kept me going. As a developer I figured I would never reach 
a point where I would feel I can't learn more or can't achieve more.
So here I am - enjoying this journey with so much new stuff to learn and to try! :D
